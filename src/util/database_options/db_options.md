# DB OPTIONS

Because there are so many ways to implement a database for a bot, there will not be any premade implementations. This is primarily to prevent bloating the amount of packages the repo comes with. In the future, I may make some separate branches that implement certain database drivers (most likely the sql server drivers from the mssql NPM package).
